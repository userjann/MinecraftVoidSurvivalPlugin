# Minecraft plugins for void survival

This project contains two Minecraft plugins. They are intended to be used at the same time but also work individually. I recommend using the plugins on a Minecraft server with a Void World map, where there are no resources available. The ItemGenerator gives all the players every five seconds one of the following items and a given probability: 

- Cobblestone: 20%
- Oak plank: 20%
- Stick: 20%
- Dirt: 20%
- Iron nugget: 10%
- Gold nugget: 9.5%
- Diamond: 0.5%
